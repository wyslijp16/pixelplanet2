Just to the 2nd anniversary of r/space, pixelplanet takes pixelgames to a new level. Place pixels, create pixelart and fight faction wars on pixelplanet.fun.
Pixelplanet is a 65k x 65k large canvas that is a map of the world and can also be seen as 3d globe, you can place pixels where ever you want, build an island, take over another country with a flag or just create pixelart.
30 well chosen colors (decided by polls within the community) are available and you can place a pixel every 3s on an empty space, and 5s on an already set pixel. But pixels can be stacked up to a minute, so you don't have to wait every time.

Pixelplanet receives regular updates and launches events, like a zero second cooldown day on r/place anniversary. We are driven by our community, because placing pixels is more fun together.

Controls:
W, A, S, D, click and drag or pan: Move
Q, E or scroll or pinch: Zoom
Click or tab: Place Pixel

## Build
### Requirements
- [nodejs environment](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Building
Checkout repository

```
git clone https://github.com/pixelplanetdev/pixelplanet.git
cd pixelplanet
```

Install packages and build

```
npm install
npm run build
```


All needed files to run it got created in `./build`

Notes:

- If you run into problems, make sure that you have rights to g++ (if not, run as root and then chown username:username -R . after build)

- If `npm install` fails with "unable to connect to github.com" set:

```
git config --global url.https://github.com/.insteadOf git://github.com/
```

## Run
### Requirements
- nodejs environment with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) (`npm install -g pm2`) as process manager and for logging
- [redis](https://redis.io/) as database for storìng the canvas
- mysql or mariadb ([setup own user](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-new-user-and-grant-permissions-in-mysql) and [create database](https://www.w3schools.com/SQl/sql_create_db.asp) for pixelplanet) for storing additional data like IP blacklist

| BACKUP_DIR        | mounted directory of backup server    | "/mnt/backup/"     |

Notes:

- to be able to use USE_PROXYCHECK, you have to have an account on proxycheck.io or getipintel or another checker setup and you might set some proxies in `src/proxies.json` (before building) that get used for making proxycheck requests. Look into `src/isProxy.js` to see how things work, but keep in mind that this isn't neccessarily how pixelplanet.fun uses it.
- Admins are users with 0cd and access to `./admintools` for image-upload and whatever
- You can find out the id of a user by looking into the logs (i.e. `info: {ip} / {id} wants to place 2 in (1701, -8315)`) when he places a pixel or by checking the MySql Users database

#### Social Media

| Variable              | Description              |

Notes:

- The HTML for SocialMedia logins is in src/componets/UserAreaModal.js , delete stuff from there if you don't need it
- The HTML for the Help Screen is in src/components/HelpModal.js

Canvas specific configuartion like colors and cooldown is in `src/canvases.json` for all canvases.
The CanvasSize is expected to be a power of 4 (4096, 16384, 65536) and not smaller than 256 and not larger than 65536 (you can however change the websocket packages in src/socket/packages/ to send chunk coordinates in 16bit and surpas that limit).
bcd is base cooldown for unset pixels, pcd is cooldown for placing on top of others, cds is stacktime, req is the requirement to be allowed to set on canvas in total pixels placed (or -1 for no requirement or 0 for having to be registered). `sd` is the start-date of the canvas, its used to know the oldest available backup (see Backup & Historical View section). All the cooldown values are in ms.
cli is the numbers of colors to ignore for the player palette, i.e. the given world is made out of blue ocean and white continents with those two colors being the first two in the palette and they are used to know if a pixel got set by a player or not, so cli = 2 here.
If you want to add a new canvas, be sure that you additionally create `public/loading${canvasId}.png`, `public/assets3d/normal${canvasId}.jpg`, `public/preview${canvasId}.png` and `public/assets3d/specular${canvasId}.jpg`, check out the existing ones to see what those files are for.
If `v` is set to true for a canvas, it will be a 3D canvas.

The default configuration values can be seen in `src/core/config.js` and for the canvases in `src/core/constats.js`

### Running

1. Make sure that mysql and redis are running
3. Start with 

```
pm2 start ecosystem.yml
```

Notes:

- pixelplanet uses the unix command sendmail for sending verification and password reset mails. If you are on windows, this might not work.
- It might be neccessary to change the charset and collate of the sql colum names of table Users to support special character names, which can be done with the SQL command:
```
ALTER TABLE Users CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci';
```

### Logging
logs are in ~/pm2/log/, you can view them with

```
pm2 log web 
```

you can flush the logs with 

```
pm2 log flush
```

### Stopping
```
pm2 stop web
```

### If using Cloudflare / Reverse Proxy
In order to get the real IP and not use the cloudflare Proxy IP for placing pixels, we filter those out. The cloudflare IPs are in src/utils/cloudflareip.js and used in src/utils/ip.js. If for some reason cloudflare ads more IPs to it, you can see them at https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/ and add them.
If you use any other Reverse Proxy, you can define it's IPs there too.

If USE\_XREALIP is set, we take the IP from the X-Real-Ip header without checking for cloudflare IPs. Use this if you have pixelplanet running behind nginx use the nginx set\_realip module to give us the client ip on the X-Real-Ip header. And be sure to also forward X-Forwarded-Port and set X-Forwarded-Proto.

### Auto-Start
To have the canvas with all it's components autostart at systemstart,
enable mysql, redis (and probably nginx if you use it) according to your system (`systemctl enable ...`)
And then setup pm2 startup with:
```
pm2 startup
```
(execute as the user that is running pixelplanet)
And follow the printed steps if needed. This will generate a systemctl service file `/etc/systemd/system/pm2-pixelplanet.service` and enable it. You will have to run `pm2 save` while the canvas is running to let pm2 know what to start.
To make sure that mysql and redis are up when pixelplanet starts, edit this service file and modify the lines:
```
Wants=network-online.target
After=network.target mysql.service redis.service
```

### Development

Run `npm run lint:src` to check for code errors and warnings or `npm run lint -- ./your/file.js` to check a single file.
We have enough warnings already, just don't produce too many additional ones.

You can use `npm run babel-node ./your/script.js` to execute a script with local babel.

`npm run upgrade` can be use for interactively upgrading npm packages.

## Backups and Historical View

PixelPlanet includes a backup script that creates full canvas backups daily in the form of PNG tile files and incremential backups all 15min (or whatever you define) that saves PNG tiles with just the differences since the last full daily backup.

It requires a [second running redis instance](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/multiple-redis-instances-on-ubuntu-16-04).

The backup script gets built when building pixelplanet and also gets copied to build/ directory. You can run it with:

```
node backup.js REDIS_URL_CANVAS REDIS_URL_BACKUP BACKUP_DIRECTORY [INTERVAL] [COMMAND]
```

Make sure to get the order right, because the backup redis instance will be overwritten every hour.
Interval is the time in minutes between incremential backups. If interval is undefined, it will just make one backup and then exit.
If command is defined, it will be executed after every backup (just one command, with no arguments, like "dosomething.sh"), this is useful for synchronisation with a storage server i.e..

Alternatively you can run it with pm2, just like pixelplanet. An example ecosystem-backup.example.yml file will be located in the build directory.

Note:
- You do not have to run backups or historical view, it's optional.

### Historical view

![historicalview](promotion/historicalview.gif)

Pixelplanet is able to let the user browse through the past with those backups. For this you need to define `BACKUP_URL` and `BACKUP_DIR` in your ecosystem.yml for pixelplanet.
`BACKUP_URL` is the URL where the backup folder is available. It's best to let another server serve those files or at least use nginx.
`BACKUP_DIR` is the full path of the local directory where the backup is located (whats set as `BACKUP_DIRECTORY` in the command of the backup.js).

## 3D canvas

If v is set and true for a canvas in the canvas.json, it will be a 3D voxel canvas.
3D Canvases can not be seen in Historical View.
